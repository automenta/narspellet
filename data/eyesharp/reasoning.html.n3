Reasoning is grounded in First Order Logic - What is Logic?

Logic is stable and universal, and is identified with classical first order
logic. Other logics are here considered to be first order theories,
syntactically sugared in notationally convenient forms. From this point of view
higher order logic is essentially first order set theory.

The most natural, intuitive and fruitful approach turned out to be the
axiomatization, in the predicate calculus notation, of the concept of a set.
Once this was done the way was cleared for a proper semantic foundation to be
given to FOL itself. The rigorous mathematical concept of an interpretation,
and of the denotation of a formula within an interpretation, was introduced by
Alfred Tarski, who thus completed, in 1929, the fundamentals of the semantics
of FOL.

The notion of logical consequence could now be defined by saying that a
sentence S logically follows from a sentence P if there is no interpretation in
which P is true and S is false.

This now made it possible to raise the following fundamental question about
FOL: is the following Completeness Theorem provable: for all sentences S and P,
S is formally derivable from P if and only if S logically follows from P?

The question was soon positively answered, independently, in their respective
doctoral theses, by two graduate students. Kurt Gödel received his degree on
February 6, 1930 at the University of Vienna, aged 23, and Jacques Herbrand
received his at the Sorbonne on 11 June, 1930, aged 22.

The theorem is so important because the property of formal derivability is
semidecidable: there is an algorithm by means of which, if a sentence S is in
fact formally derivable from a sentence P, then this fact can be mechanically
detected. Indeed, the detection procedure is usually organized in such a way
that the detection consists of actually constructing a derivation of S from P.
In other words, when looked at semantically, the syntactic detection algorithm
becomes a proof procedure.

Turing's 1936 paper on Hilbert's Decision Problem was crucial. Ostensibly it
was yet another attempt to characterize with mathematical precision the concept
of computability, which he needed to do in order to show that there is no fixed
computation procedure by means of which every definite mathematical assertion
can be decided (determined to be true or determined to be false).

Alonzo Church independently reached the same result at essentially the same
time, using his own quite different computational theory of
lambda-definability. In either form, its significance for computational logic
is that it proved the impossibility of a decision procedure for FOL. The
semidecision procedure reflecting the deductive completeness of FOL is all
there is, and we have to be content to work with that.

'''Logic'''

  There are a number of ways of approaching the issues, but for purposes here a
  *logic* can be thought of as a (typically rather large and inclusive) family
of   formal languages together with a semantic theory for those languages.

'''Semantic Theory'''

  A *semantic theory* for a class of languages is simply a systematic method of
  assigning semantic values to the members of the various syntactic categories
of   those languages.   The Semantic Web model distinguishes properties and
classes considered as   objects from their extensions - the sets of
object-value pairs which satisfy   the property, or things that are 'in' the
class - thereby allowing the extension   of a property or class to contain the
property or class itself without violating   the axiom of foundation.

'''Interpretation'''

  An application of a semantic theory to a particular language yields an  
*interpretation* of the language, i.e., an assignment of appropriate semantic  
values to the basic lexical items of the language. Appropriate semantic values
  are then assigned by the theory to complex syntactic constructions of the  
language -- notably, truth and falsity to sentences -- recursively in terms of
  the semantic values of their component parts.

'''First Order Logic'''

  What makes a logic *first-order* is a fairly technical matter, but it
consists   essentially in the possession of two semantic properties,
compactness and the   downward Löwenheim-Skolem property. These properties are
critically connected   to the fact that FOL is *complete*, that is, that it is
possible to *axiomatize*   logical consequence, i.e., the fundamental logical
relation that holds between   a set S of sentences and a given sentence A when
any interpretation that makes   all the members of S true also makes A true. It
is (among other things)   completeness that makes FOL so important to automated
reasoning, as it means   that, whenever A is a logical consequence of S in a
first-order logic, there is   actually a *proof* of A from some (finite) subset
of S. (Alas, finding that   proof is another kettle of fish entirely, which is
why we have more constrained,   less expressive logics like description logics
and their ilk.)

ps: Re compactness and the downward L-S property, for those who might be
interested: Say that a set S of sentences of a logic is *satisfiable* if there
is *model* of S, that is, an interpretation of the language of the logic in
which all the members of S are true, and that S is *unsatisfiable* if it is not
satisfiable. Compactness says, roughly, that unsatisfiability is in a certain
sense a finite property; more exactly, compactness says that if a set S of
sentences is unsatisfiable, then some finite subset of S is as well. From the
compactness of FOL follows the very interesting fact that FOL is incapable of
expressing the concept of finitude.

The downward L-S property says, roughly, that it is not possible to force all
of the models of any set of sentences to be larger than the set N of natural
numbers; more exactly, a logic has the downward L-S property if, whenever, a
set of sentences has an infinite model of any size, it also has a model the
size of N.

The characterization of first-order logic in terms of compactness and the
downward L-S property is known as Lindström's Theorem.
