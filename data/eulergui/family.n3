# Suppose we want to a have the Knowledge Base entail :
# Every Human has a grandparent.

# Then we must first "define" grandparent by a rule using parent in the antecedent.
{ ?X :parent ?P.
  ?P :parent ?GP.
} => {
?X :grandparent ?GP }.

# Then we must have an existential rule for the primitive notion of parent.
{
  ?X a :Human .
} => {
  ?X :parent ?P.
  ?P a :Human .
}.
