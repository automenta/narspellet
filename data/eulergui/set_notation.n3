    # that is accepted but must be ($ :c .... $) 
# <rszeno> missing $

# <rszeno> seems that both are set notations
# <rszeno> {$ + $} and items comma separated
# <rszeno> ($ + $) without comma between items

# <rszeno> there are few other things obscure in cwm, for example [= and :=
# <rszeno> := is for applying patches after a delta diff
# <rszeno> first is something with blank nodes and = combined
# <rszeno> i didn't test if they even work in cwm, :)
